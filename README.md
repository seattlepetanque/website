seattlepetanque.org website source

This repo contains the source for the seattlepetanque.org website.

The current site is built using publii (getpublii.com), an open-source static site CMS.

The code here is currently just the zipfile backup dumps. We aren't using any of publii's git integration tools.

To modify the site, you should be able to download the newest backup zip file, restore it from backup in publii, and make whatever changes you want. Save and preview the changes until you are happy with them, then "sync to your website" using our sftp credentials with our web hosting platform. Make sure to then create a new backup to store here.
